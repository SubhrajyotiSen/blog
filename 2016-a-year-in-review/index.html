            <p>I have never really done a year in review before. The reason being that I never had a year that I thought was worth a review. <br>
But this year was quite different. The first year I am truly proud of. </p>

<h4 id="favouritestthingoftheyear">Favouritest thing of the year</h4>

<p>(Yes, that was an intentional typo :P)
<img src="https://github.com/SubhrajyotiSen/blog/raw/gh-pages/content/images/others/GH_Contributions.png" alt="Github">
The best about the year was my GitHub contributions graph. I went from 0 contributions in 2015 to 609 in 2016. I also contributed to multiple Open Source projects throughout the year (HacktoberFest being a special bonus). <br>
I was also able to publish my first Android Library <a href="https://github.com/SubhrajyotiSen/PasswordView">PasswordView</a> which seemed to have gotten a decent response. </p>

<h4 id="androiddevelopernanodegree">Android Developer Nanodegree</h4>

<p>In march, I received a scholarship to pursue the Android Developer Nanodegree  at Udacity. It has been an amazing learning experience till now. I never really thought I would be making widgets and watchfaces for my app anytime soon. But the Nanodegree changed that. Two months till graduation (Yaay :D)</p>

<h4 id="mozilla">Mozilla</h4>

<p>After a lot of delay, I was finally able to start my contributions to Mozilla. I started out with One and Done tests and now I'm actively taking part in Firefox Test days. <br>
Next up was localising articles in Bengali (which helped me improve my rusting Bengali too xD ). <br>
Another amazing thing which I was able to do was <a href="https://subhrajyotisen.wordpress.com/2016/07/29/maker-part-16-day-1/">teaching kids about the Web</a></p>

<h4 id="helioxandroms">Heliox and ROMs</h4>

<p>After trying for a really long time, I was finally able to build my own Android kernel called Heliox and compile tons of custom ROMs for my phone. One hell of an experience. A big shout out to Sarthak Narang, Nachiket Namjoshi and Rohit Poroli for being the best guides in my journey. </p>

<p>Here's hoping to another amazing year. Until next time..</p>
